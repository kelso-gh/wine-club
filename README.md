# Bad Grapes Wine Club

BGWC is an application centered around wine! Through signing up with their e-mail (OAUTH) they are able to log-in and start building wine bundles. The idea is that people can come to the sight, upload a picture of a wine they tried, list it's attributes and add it to a "bundle" that they've named. On the user's home page their is a list of their bundles and other users bundles as they've added them. They then can leave reviews on the recommended bundles and also on their own! It's a great way for wine lovers to communicate and suggest wines they love.
